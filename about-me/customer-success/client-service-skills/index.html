I <strong>prefer partnering</strong> with them through a <strong>mutually beneficial relationship</strong> that achieves goals. However, as we all know, we can't always choose our clients, especially if they were passed on to us from someone else, and at some point we have to <strong>deal with challenging</strong> clients to find common ground. To paraphrase what a mentor once told me: </p> <blockquote>Relationships are not cast in stone - we can always turn them around for the better. It all depends on how much work we want to put into it.</blockquote> <div class="card shadow text-bg-light mb-4" id="client-relationships"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title mb-2"><i class="fa-regular fa-bolt"></i> Client Relationships</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Fostering healthy dynamics through diligence, friendliness & candor</h6> <p class="card-text small">The foundation of a successful business is a great product, while its pillars are its <strong>relationships</strong> with its clients - it can only rise to great heights if such pillars are <strong>strong</strong>. When constructing such pillars, I rely on <strong>values</strong> instilled in me from a young age - <strong>diligence</strong>, <strong>civility</strong>, and <strong>honesty</strong> - as the main building blocks, and then reinforcing these with <strong>friendliness</strong> and <strong>candor</strong> over the years.</p> <div class="clearfix"></div> <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary w-100" type="button" data-bs-target="#client-relationships-details" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-expanded='<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i> show less <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i>'> <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> tell me more <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> </button> <div class="collapse pt-3" id="client-relationships-details"> <p class="card-text small">I gain the respect and trust of clients by <strong>proving my competence and dedication</strong> to delivering them a great product / service from the get-go, and win their fondness by making an effort to maintain a bright and cheerful demeanor at every opportunity.</p> <p class="card-text small">The challenge in building relationships with clients is that such relationships are inherently transactional and governed by the busy schedules of both parties. I, therefore, make an effort to be very <strong>consistent</strong> in leaving <strong>positive impressions</strong> after every client <a href="/about-me/customer-success/interpersonal-skills/#effective-communication">interaction</a>, that eventually grows into strong relationships.</p> <p class="card-text small">I learned this from a mentor, who taught me that <strong>being liked by clients</strong> is just <strong>as important as</strong> doing a <strong>good job</strong>. This may eventually flourish to something akin to friendship - I remember this one time I went to Singapore for a conference, I surprised a client's team by bringing them some Filipino <em>ensaymadas</em> because they had mentioned it during a call months before; it was a gesture that was motivated not by the desire to be liked, but by the desire to honor and reinforce a years-long relationship.</p> <p class="card-text small">While every client relationship is unique, I found that these are some of the common elements that generally make them successful.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card shadow text-bg-light mb-4" id="customer-service"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title mb-2"><i class="fa-regular fa-bolt"></i> Customer Service</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Exceeding expectations by both fulfilling and anticipating needs</h6> <p class="card-text small">All of my career mentors share one thing in common: they always deliver results, by hook or by crook. However, one of them stands out among the rest in a way that shaped the way I work, which is to <strong>anticipate client needs</strong>. I did not appreciate this at the time, because it felt like I couldn't get anything right, but I eventually came to understand its importance in a highly competitive world.</p> <div class="clearfix"></div> <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary w-100" type="button" data-bs-target="#customer-service-details" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-expanded='<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i> show less <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i>'> <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> tell me more <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> </button> <div class="collapse pt-3" id="customer-service-details"> <p class="card-text small">Everyone knows or, at least, have a good idea of what good customer service is like. We can also tell when the service is excellent - and this is when the service exceeds our expectations. While this can come in many forms, I found that <strong>being ready</strong> to provide what a client needs <strong>before they even ask</strong> almost always <strong>impresses</strong> clients.</p> <p class="card-text small">I have been able to use this in a variety of situations, which can be as simple as mentioning that I've done some testing on a feature that they might be interested in, or as elaborate as thoroughly analyzing an issue they raised, identifying gaps that immediately stand out, and proposing a variety of solutions with their pros and cons.</p> <p class="card-text small">But, alas, if only we could provide everything that a client asks for and anticipate every need that they may have! That is why I always strike a <strong>balance</strong> between providing <strong>excellent customer service</strong> and the <strong>limited resources</strong> I have by properly <a href="/about-me/customer-success/interpersonal-skills/#expectation-management">managing client expectations</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card shadow text-bg-light mb-4" id="project-management"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title mb-2"><i class="fa-regular fa-bolt"></i> Project Management</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Directing efforts to efficiently achieve quality results</h6> <p class="card-text small">When clients come to me with a <strong>large problem</strong>, I learned how to approach it by <strong>breaking it down</strong> into smaller, more <strong>manageable pieces</strong> that, at the end, can be <strong>brought back together</strong> in a way that <strong>works well</strong>. I usually start with <strong>identifying</strong> the <em>ultimate goal</em> and the <em>reasons</em> why the goal exists, then I <strong>assess</strong> the <em>resources available</em> at my disposal in order to <em>allocate them strategically</em>. When working with a <a href="/about-me/customer-success/interpersonal-skills/#teamwork">team</a>, I use a strengths-based approach to make full use of everyone's skills and to foster good team morale.</p> <div class="clearfix"></div> <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary w-100" type="button" data-bs-target="#project-management-details" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-expanded='<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i> show less <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i>'> <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> tell me more <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> </button> <div class="collapse pt-3" id="project-management-details"> <p class="card-text small">In my experience, all major tasks (such as the creation of this website) must be <strong>guided</strong> by a <u>clearly defined reason or purpose</u> that must also (ideally) be <u>understood by all those involved</u>.

The timeline was flexible, but still guided by a self-imposed sense of urgency.</p> <p class="card-text small">In relation to <strong>client projects</strong>, the same principles apply, but with the added complexity of <strong>multiple stakeholders</strong> and <strong>decision-makers</strong> who <em>may each have competing interests and different perspectives on</em> the project. This results in challenging issues, but I have found that <strong>identifying the end-users</strong> of the product (who are usually not the decision-makers) and <strong>providing what they need</strong> out of such product is a <strong>great starting point</strong> in resolving the issues.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card shadow text-bg-light mb-4" id="client-retention"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title mb-2"><i class="fa-regular fa-bolt"></i> Client Retention</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Keeping the product / service valuable to keep their business</h6> <p class="card-text small">To paraphrase an old saying, <em>it takes the entire company to keep clients from taking their business elsewhere</em>.
