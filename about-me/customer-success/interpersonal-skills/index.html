In order to navigate through the <strong>complexity</strong> of such interactions, I developed the necessary skills needed to build a <strong>productive relationship</strong> best suited for each client.</p> <p>Here are <strong>key examples</strong> of such skills.</p> <div class="card shadow text-bg-light mb-4" id="effective-communication"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title mb-2"><i class="fa-regular fa-bolt"></i> Effective Communication</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Using words to achieve goals</h6> <p class="card-text small">I strive to make every client interaction as <strong>productive</strong> and <strong>meaningful</strong> as I can. In order to achieve that, I always prepare before interacting with clients, <strong>ask the right questions</strong>, listen closely to their replies, and assess the situation so that I may carefully construct the appropriate response.</p> <div class="clearfix"></div> <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary w-100" type="button" data-bs-target="#effective-communication-details" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-expanded='<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i> show less <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i>'> <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> tell me more <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> </button> <div class="collapse pt-3" id="effective-communication-details"> <p class="card-text small">The response needs to clearly convey the <strong>intent</strong> of the message, whether to reassure, instruct, advise, or otherwise inform. I achieve this using a <strong>variety of techniques</strong>, such as through the use of words carefully chosen depending on their levity or gravity, controlling the length of the message, and emphasizing for clarity or intentionally creating ambiguity, among others.</p> <p class="card-text small">One's ability to communicate effectively can <strong>make or break</strong> relationships with customers. I remember a time back when I was a Mobility Coordinator, an assignment case was passed on to me from a teammate because the assignee in question was very unhappy with the support they've been receiving. It turned out that the assignee was unhappy because they felt that they weren't being treated like an executive under the new plan types. It took several <strong>difficult phone calls</strong> and <strong>carefully-worded emails</strong> explaining why they couldn't stay on the former plan types, but they were finally able to adjust their expectations based on new realities.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card shadow text-bg-light mb-4" id="emotional-intelligence"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title mb-2"><i class="fa-regular fa-bolt"></i> Emotional Intelligence</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Enhanced human interactions, emotional responsibility</h6> <p class="card-text small">I treat <strong>clients</strong> as fellow humans, <strong>more than just paying customers</strong>. As a <strong>co-worker</strong>, I regard my colleagues as good neighbors with whom I need to work harmoniously. As a <strong>leader</strong>, I aspire to lead by example, always conscious of the responsibility that comes with the power and influence I have over my direct reports. </p> <div class="clearfix"></div> <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary w-100" type="button" data-bs-target="#emotional-intelligence-details" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-expanded='<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i> show less <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i>'> <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> tell me more <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> </button> <div class="collapse pt-3" id="emotional-intelligence-details"> <p class="card-text small"> In addition to learning how to effectively communicate, I developed the ability to relate to a client by being <strong>sincere</strong> and <strong>genuinely</strong> willing to partner with them to achieve their business goals. I found that this goes a long way when working with clients because it adds a human dimension to the <a href="/about-me/customer-success/client-service-skills/#client-relationships">relationship</a>, as opposed to simply establishing a transactional connection.</p> <p class="card-text small">Far from being the mere exchange of pleasantries at the start of every conversation, this requires being <strong>attuned</strong> to the words a client is using, how they say it, and also what they leave unsaid to <strong>truly understand</strong> their message. In order to do that, I <strong>recognize</strong> and keep my <strong>own emotions in check</strong> so I can maintain control of the situation. </p> <p class="card-text small"> Taking an emotionally intelligent approach when interacting with clients allows me to better structure my responses to <strong>influence the outcome</strong>, as well as determine and prioritize the appropriate course of action based on urgency - thus, best accomplishing the goals of both parties.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card shadow text-bg-light mb-4" id="expectation-management"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title mb-2"><i class="fa-regular fa-bolt"></i> Expectation Management</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Keeping everyone on the same page</h6> <p class="card-text small">I help clients <strong>understand what can be done</strong> and <strong>when</strong> it will be done by <strong>candidly explaining</strong> the <strong>whys</strong> and the <strong>hows</strong>. It is natural for clients to get very excited about great products/services and I know how to <strong>harness that excitement</strong> to yield maximum results, tempering any overabundance of it by <strong>setting realistic expectations</strong> but also being careful not to douse it with a cold splash of unbridled realism.</p> <div class="clearfix"></div> <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary w-100" type="button" data-bs-target="#expectation-management-details" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-expanded='<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i> show less <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i>'> <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> tell me more <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> </button> <div class="collapse pt-3" id="expectation-management-details"> <p class="card-text small">I developed this skill due to the <strong>limited resources</strong> available at my disposal at any given time (mostly in the form of time and manpower), which have to be <strong>carefully balanced</strong> with meeting the <strong>expectations</strong> of multiple stakeholders.</p> <p class="card-text small">Expectation management may have the connotation of dealing with already unhappy customers but, based on my experience, <strong>regularly</strong> setting and managing expectations actually help build trusting <a href="/about-me/customer-success/client-service-skills/#client-relationships">relationships</a> with clients, and can actually increase satisfaction. It may be difficult at first, as many clients will naturally put up resistance against any response that they do not like, but I found that giving a <strong>comprehensive explanation</strong> of the situation usually resolves things.</p> <p class="card-text small">After all, the vast <strong>majority of clients are reasonable</strong> and fully understand that things take time and are happy to wait, provided their expectations are clearly set.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card shadow text-bg-light mb-4" id="negotiation"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title mb-2"><i class="fa-regular fa-bolt"></i> Negotiation</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Exploring what works best for both parties</h6> <p class="card-text small">I <strong>listen carefully</strong> to the client's problems, then I tell them <strong>what's possible</strong>, and we <strong>work our way</strong> from there. In general, my approach is to <strong>persuade</strong> by clearly enumerating what they <strong>stand to gain</strong> from my proposal and by being prepared to <strong>back it up</strong> with solid supporting evidence.</p> <div class="clearfix"></div> <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary w-100" type="button" data-bs-target="#negotiation-details" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-expanded='<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i> show less <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i>'> <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> tell me more <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> </button> <div class="collapse pt-3" id="negotiation-details"> <p class="card-text small">I found that the approach works with most clients because even in cases where we do not always get the benefit of having a pre-existing good relationship with a particular client, <strong>being confident</strong> and <strong>ready to defend</strong> your proposal makes for a <strong>strong bargaining position</strong>.</p> <p class="card-text small">When I get a <strong>no</strong>, I <strong>respect</strong> their decision but still <strong>keep an eye out</strong> for future opportunities to demonstrate the soundness of my proposal.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card shadow text-bg-light mb-4" id="teamwork"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title mb-2"><i class="fa-regular fa-bolt"></i> Teamwork</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">A strengths-based strategy towards a common goal</h6> <p class="card-text small">It takes a team to keep clients happy. I've had experience joining a team, welcoming new members into a team, and forming a team - in all situations, I found that <strong>team culture</strong> is important, and it takes the cooperation of everyone to build <strong>healthy team dynamics</strong> in order to <strong>bring the best out</strong> of each team member.

I never really understood why people say "think outside the box", when you're supposed to take the game out of it in the first place.</p> <p class="card-text small"><strong>Resourcefulness</strong> - I was raised in a household with limited means, and <u>resources</u> had to be <u>stretched</u>, even time. When I was around nine, my busy mother taught me how to use Merriam-Webster's English dictionary to look up word definitions (a subtle hint to stop treating her like a 90s Alexa) - I felt like a grown-up. Fast forward to about six months in to my job at IBM, and my first career mentor told me frankly that I had to be resourceful, to <u>exhaust all materials</u> I can get my hands on and use <u>all tools at my disposal</u> to do my job. These are only two of the examples of life experiences where I was pushed to be resourceful, and I take pride in being someone who is.</p> <p class="card-text small"><strong>Attention to Detail</strong> - <em>The devil is in the details</em>, as the old adage goes. My first job had a lot of strict Operational Metrics where <u>a single mistake</u> had <u>severe repercussions</u> on the entire business unit, which was succintly described by a co-worker and dear friend when she half-jokingly said: <em>"báwal magkámalì"</em> (no mistakes are allowed) while showing me the ropes. While this does not apply to every job, it became part of my ideal work ethic.</p> <p class="card-text small"><strong>Adaptability</strong> - Everything is in constant flux, and I learned to <u>allow</u> myself be swept away by <u>fair winds</u>. Not all change is good, though, and I also know to <u>dig my heels in</u> and remain <u>steadfast</u> to what I believe is <u>right</u>. In the workplace, I apply this by <u>quickly realigning</u> my expectations, plans, or goals to supervening <u>events</u> that are <u>beyond my influence and control</u>.</p> <p class="card-text small"><strong>Resilience</strong> - It is general knowledge that we are <u>continually faced with life's challenges</u>. Whether at work, such as running my own company and working with assertive clients, or home, such as taking care of my parents who were both stricken with cancer, I <u>doggedly face and overcome</u> such challenges, and come out of them much <u>wiser than before</u>.</p> <p class="card-text small"><strong>Decision-Making</strong> - I endeavor to responsibly make <u>well-thought-out decisions</u>, always <u>guided</u> by their <u>possible consequences</u>. However, I also know full well that there are many occasions where I <u>do not have</u> the <u>luxury of time</u> to mull over the right course of action - in such cases, I base my decisions on <u>available information</u> emboldened by <u>gut instinct</u>.</p> <p class="card-text small"><strong>A Sense of Urgency</strong> - The work I do <u>has impact</u> on other people's lives, <u>no matter how small</u>, and I have come to learn that having a sense of urgency is <u>basic</u> in <u>customer service</u>. To what degree? Definitely <u>nothing less than the minimum</u> of what a client should <u>expect</u>, but also (maybe) <u>not as extreme</u> as what Anne Hathaway's character described in <a target="_blank" href="https://johnaugust.com/Assets/DEVIL_WEARS_PRADA_Full_Script.pdf#page=36"><em>Devil Wears Prada</em></a>.</p> <blockquote>"And they all act like they’re curing cancer or something ...

This has guided me ever since I read a book on philosophy back in college.
