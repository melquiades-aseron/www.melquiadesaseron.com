In all my years doing this, I developed skills that allow to me <strong>transform business needs into sustainable solutions</strong> within a software.</p> <div class="card shadow text-bg-light mb-4" id="assignmentpro"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title mb-2"><i class="fa-regular fa-bolt"></i> AssignmentPro™</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">The gold standard within the mobility tech industry</h6> <p class="card-text small"><strong>My expertise</strong> in AssignmentPro™ comes from my experience when I first implemented and used it <strong>as a client</strong>, and then as a member of Equus's <strong>Client Services team</strong> in charge of providing implementation and ongoing support. This rich set of experiences in using this product has given me a powerful ability to <strong>think ahead for clients</strong> when using it to creatively build solutions that transform the way they work. </p> <p class="card-text small">Given AssignmentPro™'s position within enterprise software / SaaS industry, <strong>I gained valuable and firsthand experience</strong> working for a <strong>market leader</strong>, thus equipping me with the <strong>mindset</strong> necessary to <strong>work in leading tech firms</strong>.</p> </div> </div> <div class="card shadow text-bg-light mb-4" id="client-onboarding"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title mb-2"><i class="fa-regular fa-bolt"></i> Client Onboarding</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Setting the client up for success</h6> <p class="card-text small">This crucial stage of every client relationship determines its success, both in the short term and the long term. Ensuring a client is properly onboarded means more than just establishing initial contact with the client and equipping with the knowledge about the software solution and explaining everyone's roles and responsibilities - in my experience, this critical stage is when <strong>I demonstrate</strong> to the client the <strong>value of the product</strong> and <strong>reaffirm</strong> the fact that they <strong>made the right decision</strong> in purchasing it.</p> <p class="card-text small">Thus, I treat this stage with utmost importance because <strong>first impressions do last</strong>. However, in the event that everything <strong>doesn´t</strong> go according to plan, <strong>I exert additional effort</strong> to rectify any issues that occurred during the client onboarding stage, always bearing in mind that a balance must be struck between the interests of the both the company and the client.</p> <div class="clearfix"></div> <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary w-100" type="button" data-bs-target="#client-onboarding-details" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-expanded='<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i> show less <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i>'> <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> tell me more <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> </button> <div class="collapse pt-3" id="client-onboarding-details"> <p class="card-text small">I also learned that this <strong>doesn't only occur</strong> at the very <strong>beginning</strong> of the client relationship, as client representatives / <strong>contacts change over time</strong>. Therefore, I <strong>invest time</strong> onboarding new contacts as they join the client organization, taking the <strong>opportunity</strong> not just to teach them how to use the product / service but also to demonstrate its <strong>value over others</strong> that they have used in the past. This <strong>reduces the risk</strong> of client turnover as it <strong>avoids</strong> having the new client contact <strong>advocate switching</strong> to a competitor.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card shadow text-bg-light mb-4" id="software-implementation"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title mb-2"><i class="fa-regular fa-bolt"></i> Software Implementation</h5> <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Building sustainable solutions</h6> <p class="card-text small"><strong>I advise stakeholders</strong> that it is important <strong>not to make</strong> the <strong>mistake</strong> of using the opportunity to <strong>overhaul</strong> existing business processes while <strong>implementing</strong> a new system. Instead, <strongu>I direct their focus</strong> to building a system in a way that <strong>provides all the essential</strong> needs of users while keeping it <strong>flexible enough</strong> to accommodate future changes. This calls for the ability to strike a delicate balance between designing a solution that's sustainable / easy to maintain and properly incorporating minute yet critical details - not an easy feat, considering that people will always <strong>struggle</strong> to <strong>shift their mindset</strong> from their old ways of doing things to a new one.</p> <p class="card-text small">As <strong>proper documentation</strong> during this stage is critical for future reference, <strong>I meticulously keep records</strong> of important information throughout, which include the identified requirements, the proposed solutions, the decisions made and the reasons for choosing one option over another.</p> <p class="card-text small">There is also usually a lot of strong emotions during the implementation stage, which can range from excitement to apprehension. Therefore, I found that it is important to set and manage expectations during this time, whether to moderate excessive excitement or to dispel any doubts that anyone involved may have.</p> <div class="clearfix"></div> <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary w-100" type="button" data-bs-target="#software-implementation-details" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-expanded='<i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i> show less <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-up"></i>'> <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> tell me more <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i> </button> <div class="collapse pt-3" id="software-implementation-details"> <p class="card-text small">Depending on the organization and resource availability, different people or teams may get involved at different stages of an implementation. While safeguards can always be put in place to prevent <strong>knowledge loss</strong>, I learned from experience that it is important to <strong>invest time</strong> in identifying the right people involved in the project from the very beginning and consistently <strong>keeping them involved</strong> all throughout.</p> <p class="card-text small">I remember being pulled to present the initial process to a major client when it was implemented by other individuals, which ultimately ended up being clumsy and displeasing the client.
