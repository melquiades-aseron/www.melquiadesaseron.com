The journey in and of itself was both the mission and the reward, as I will recount in this second installment of the Camino de Santiago 2023 series.</p> <h3 id="preparing-for-the-journey">Preparing for the Journey</h3> <p>A <strong>lot of preparation</strong> is needed for the Camino de Santiago, and that <strong>doesn’t just mean planning</strong> the trip and <strong>packing a backpack</strong> or suitcase.</p> <p>For inexperienced hikers, they may end up biting more than they can chew with the Camino - therefore, they need to prepare themselves <strong>physically</strong> and <strong>mentally</strong> before going on it.</p> <p>As for would-be pilgrims who want to undertake the Camino for <strong>religious reasons</strong> (especially the <strong>Camiño Inglés</strong>), they should be <strong>prepared to have their faith tested</strong>, because it is not what I expected from a religious standpoint.</p> <h4 id="physical--mental-prep-work">Physical &amp; Mental Prep Work</h4> <p>Aside from clearing one’s calendar for an extended period of time (at least a week), packing a suitcase, and booking tickets and rooms, the Camino de Santiago also requires would-be pilgrims to prepare their bodies and minds for the journey.</p> <p>As someone who was raised living a sedentary lifestyle, I had to <strong>prepare myself</strong> physically and mentally for <strong>my first Camino last year</strong>. The <strong>physical preparation</strong> meant <strong>frequently going out for walks</strong> with my husband around the lovely city of A Coruña before we went on my first Camino, while the <strong>psychological</strong> part of the <strong>preparation</strong> included <strong>mental exercises</strong> such as training myself to <strong>think of walking less as a chore</strong> or a means to get somewhere, and more as a <strong>pleasant</strong> and <strong>leisurely activity</strong>. Having grown up in a hot and humid part of the world, walking is mostly pleasurable when it’s done in a climate-controlled environment - such as in a mall with great air conditioning.</p> <p><strong>This year</strong>, I needed less preparation of this kind as my previous Camino experience had already equipped me with what I needed to go on another. Nonetheless, the <strong>hilly terrain</strong> that the <strong>Camiño Inglés</strong> goes through <strong>can be very challenging</strong> for some people, and so, one has to bear that in mind when <strong>deciding which Camino</strong> they want to undertake.</p> <p>For those who wish to undertake the Camino for religious reasons, it is important to note that <strong>religious services for pilgrims</strong> seemed to be <strong>less available</strong> on the Camiño Inglés as we saw <strong>far fewer churches and chapels</strong> along the way, and those that we did see <strong>were closed</strong> when we passed by.</p> <h4 id="organizing-the-trip">Organizing the Trip</h4> <p>Save for booking the train tickets from A Coruña to Ferrol on our own, our entire Camino journey was organized for us by <strong><a href="https://tubuencamino.com" target="_blank">Tu Buen Camino</a></strong>, as I described in my <a href="/blog/2023/09/06/camino-de-santiago-2023/#using-a-professional-service">previous post</a>.</p> <h4 id="getting-to-the-starting-point">Getting to the Starting Point</h4> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-100 w-lg-50 ms-lg-3 mb-3 float-end"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-train.gif" alt="Camino de Santiago 2023 train ride to Ferrol"/> <span class="attribution">Melquiades Aseron III</span> </div> <p>Unless you already live in a Camino starting point, you will <strong>need to travel</strong> to your starting point of choice. As I mentioned in my previous post, pilgrims have the option of starting their <strong>Camiño Inglés</strong> journey from either <strong>A Coruña</strong> or <strong>Ferrol</strong>, but it didn’t really make a lot of sense starting from A Coruña because we would then have had to stay at a hotel <em>in the same city where we live</em>, and drop off our luggage there. In addition, we wouldn’t have qualified for the <a href="/blog/2023/09/06/camino-de-santiago-2023/#la-compostela">Compostela</a> as the route from A Coruña is shorter than 100km.</p> <p>Therefore, the only starting point that made sense for us was <strong>Ferrol</strong>, and we booked our train tickets on <strong>Renfe’s</strong> <a href="https://www.renfe.com/es/en" target="_blank">website</a> right after purchasing our package from Tu Buen Camino.</p> <p>The <strong>Xunta de Galicia</strong> has a great <strong><a href="https://www.caminodesantiago.gal/en/make-plans/how-to-get-there/connections-to-the-starting-points-of-the-camino" target="_blank">webpage</a></strong> that explains how to get to Camino starting points <strong>within Galicia</strong>, while this <strong><a href="https://www.pilgrim.es/en/plan-your-way/how-to-get-to-the-starting-points" target="_blank">Camino services website</a></strong> provides information on how to get to starting points in <strong>other parts of Spain</strong>, and also as far as <strong>France</strong> and <strong>Portugal</strong>.</p> <h4 id="what-to-bring">What to Bring</h4> <p>The stuff that a would-be pilgrim needs during their Camino varies widely, as it depends on factors such as:</p> <ul> <li>the <strong>time of the year</strong> (we have only done the Camino in summer),</li> <li>the <strong>type of accommodation</strong> they will be staying at during their Camino, and</li> <li>whether they’ll be using <a href="https://www.elcaminoconcorreos.com/es/envio-maletas" target="_blank">Correo’s <strong>luggage transportation service</strong></a>.</li> </ul> <h5 id="basic-travel-kit">Basic Travel Kit</h5> <p>Even if the things that a pilgrim would need depend a lot on how they choose to organize their Camino, I am listing down the <strong>basic items</strong> that my husband and I have on our list in <strong><a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a></strong> to give would-be pilgrims an idea of what to take during their Camino. For those coming in <strong>from overseas</strong>, these items don’t have to be brought in from one’s country of origin as they can all be bought here in Spain:</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://amzn.eu/d/48gD71f" target="_blank">Sunscreen</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.decathlon.es/es/p/gafas-de-sol-montana-y-senderismo-adulto-quechua-mh100/_/R-p-339362?mc=8738921" target="_blank">Sunglasses</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.decathlon.es/es/p/poncho-impermeable-de-montana-y-trekking-10l-adulto-forclaz-mt50/_/R-p-339021?mc=8737843" target="_blank">Waterproof poncho</a></strong> - It rains a lot in Galicia.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.anker.com" target="_blank">Power bank, charging brick &amp; cable</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.decathlon.es/es/p/toalla-de-microfibra-rojo-ultra-compacta-talla-xl-110-x-175-cm/_/R-p-158653?mc=8575277" target="_blank">Sports towel</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.decathlon.es/es/p/botella-termica-de-montana-y-trekking-acero-inoxidable-0-5l-quechua-mh500/_/R-p-301267?mc=8612271" target="_blank">Insulated flask</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.tiritas.es" target="_blank">Bandage strips</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.arenal.com/formato-viaje?gclid=CjwKCAjw3oqoBhAjEiwA_UaLtpnp50fRrcVyT1YoDxW8mMgjEjkoxoz_g14kPUHN3ABz5heAVG4c3hoCFLYQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">Hygiene kit</a></strong> (including <strong>soap</strong> &amp; <strong>shampoo</strong>, as I’ve read somewhere that public albergues do not provide these)</li> <li><strong><a href="https://amzn.eu/d/8AYXz7O" target="_blank">Small disposable plastic bags</a></strong> - Keep used tissues/napkins when answering the call of nature on the road in these plastic bags instead of leaving them on the ground (yes, it was distressing to see areas littered with used products). <strong>Let us be responsible &amp; respectful guest-pilgrims by not leaving filth in exchange for hospitality received</strong>.</li> </ul> <h5 id="long-distance-hiking-essentials">Long-Distance Hiking Essentials</h5> <p>In order to help Camino first-timers avoid and treat maladies that result due to walking long distances, here’s a list of recommended items:</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://amzn.eu/d/0xPOQ9y" target="_blank">Compeed Anti-Friction Sticks</a></strong> and/or <strong><a href="https://www.arenal.com/vaseline-gel-reparador-petroleum-jelly-100-ml/p/000000000000088212" target="_blank">Vaseline</a></strong> - <strong>Apply generously</strong> before setting out for the day by <strong>rubbing</strong> on the <strong>soles</strong> of your feet, <strong>in between your toes</strong>, and on the <strong>backs of your ankles</strong> (basically, the parts of your <strong>foot that rubs against your shoe/shoe</strong>).</li> <li><strong><a href="https://amzn.eu/d/cJAGGp1" target="_blank">Compeed Blister Strips</a></strong> - These help blisters heal faster by drying them out.

This <strong><a href="https://liturgiapapal.org/index.php/recursos-lit%C3%BArgicos/libros-lit%C3%BArgicos/604-misal-romano.html" target="_blank">website</a></strong> has a complete list of missals for different times of the year, while this <strong><a href="https://www.stfrancisofassisihackensack.com/documents/2020/7/Order%20of%20Mass%20-%20Spanish.pdf" target="_blank">one</a></strong> is bilingual.</li> <li><strong>Rosaries and Other Items of Devotion</strong> - As previously mentioned, the Camiño Inglés is less popular among pilgrims, and so one might be <strong>hard-pressed to find</strong> and <strong>acquire religious items</strong> along the way. Therefore, it is best to bring one’s own.</li> </ul> <h3 id="the-daily-grind">The Daily Grind</h3> <p>The Camino quickly becomes a <strong>predictable routine</strong> for pilgrims - they <strong>wake up</strong>, take a <strong>shower</strong>, <strong>prepare their feet</strong> for a long day of hiking, have <strong>breakfast</strong>, <strong>start walking</strong>, <strong>take a break</strong> at some bar or eatery, reach their <strong>destination</strong>, <strong>check into</strong> their accommodation, take another <strong>shower</strong>, <strong>nurse any injuries</strong>, have <strong>lunch</strong>, <strong>explore</strong> the place, have <strong>dinner</strong>, prepare their <strong>backpack</strong>, and finally, <strong>sleep</strong>.</p> <p>However, it is <strong>what happens in between</strong> these repeated actions that makes the Camino <strong>an unforgettable experience</strong> - socializing with other pilgrims; interacting with the kooky owners of refreshment stands; the hilarious moments in the places you stay and eat; and just the feast for the senses that you are rewarded with for embarking on the journey.</p> <h3 id="day-0-arrival-in-ferrol">Day 0: Arrival in Ferrol</h3> <p>We took a <strong>train</strong> from <strong>A Coruña to Ferrol</strong> and, after checking into our <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/MudSTjSW6Nhr6e6L9" target="_blank">hotel</a>, my husband showed me around the city before going for lunch at a nice <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/LHyzTahKsuVQ5EZ77" target="_blank">restaurant</a>.</p> <p>Due to its strategic location, <strong>Ferrol</strong> has an important <strong>naval base</strong>, which has resulted in the sacrifice of a lot of its inherent beauty as a coastal city for the sake of practicality - exemplified by the <strong>long stretch of wall</strong> along the militarized zone that <strong>obstructs views</strong> of the water. My husband describes it as <strong>a sad city</strong> because it has a <strong>beautiful view of the coast</strong> but it <strong>can’t be enjoyed</strong>.</p> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-100 w-lg-50 ms-lg-3 mb-3 float-end"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-ferrol-starting-point.jpg" alt="Camino de Santiago 2023 up a hill in Neda"/> <span class="attribution">Melquiades Aseron III</span> </div> <p>In order to <strong>simulate</strong> the experience of <strong>pilgrims arriving in Ferrol</strong> from the British Isles and Scandinavia by boat in the <strong>Middle Ages</strong>, we bought passage (€8 per person) for a <strong><a href="https://www.diariodeferrol.com/articulo/ferrol/puertos-ferrol-mugardos-cerca-mar-durante-verano-4355193" target="_blank">boat ride</a></strong> around the <strong>ría</strong> (Galician estuary, also described by a friend as a Spanish fjord), where we were shown <strong>historical sites</strong> such as the <strong><a href="https://visitferrol.com/castillo-de-san-felipe" target="_blank">Castelo de San Felipe</a></strong>. Upon disembarking from the vessel, we walked a few meters to the <strong>milestone</strong> that marks the <strong>starting point of the Camiño Inglés</strong>.</p> <p>As our hotel was located a couple of kilometers away from the docks (but still along the Camiño Inglés route), we decided to just follow the <strong><a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-yellow-arrows.jpg" class="image-modal">yellow arrows</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-mojon.jpg" class="image-modal">mojones</a></strong> (Camino milestones) on our way back to the hotel, thus technically still commencing our journey from the <a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-ferrol-marker.jpg" class="image-modal">traditional starting point</a>.</p> <div class="clearfix"></div> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>Tip #1:</em></strong> <em>If you want to get the Compostela when you arrive in Santiago de Compostela, don’t forget to get a <a href="/blog/2023/09/06/camino-de-santiago-2023/#credencial-de-peregrino">Credencial de Peregrino</a> and have it stamped at least once somewhere in the starting point.

On the other hand, the <strong>second half</strong> of the journey was where the terrain became <strong>challenging</strong> (i.e. hilly), and was made even more difficult when the sun came out from behind the clouds and bore down upon us - but that didn’t stop us from appreciating the <strong>funny side of things</strong> when we saw a <strong>pony</strong> that <strong>reminded us</strong> of <strong>celebrities</strong> - my husband thought it looked like <a href="https://time.com/4016959/justin-bieber-hair-vmas-2015" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a>, while it reminded me of <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/404409241519576916" target="_blank">Nicki Minaj</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>Tip #2:</em></strong> <em>If you decide to do the Camino in summer, I recommend saving the ice that your drink is served with whenever you take a break at some establishment - pop the ice into your flask to keep your water nice and cool!</em></p> </blockquote> <p>However, the <strong>most difficult part</strong> of this stage was arriving in Pontedeume and, to our horror, realizing that our assigned <strong><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wJ9YozVyz2KmLsgb7" target="_blank">hotel</a></strong> was <strong>located a kilometer uphill</strong> (and a <strong>steep one</strong> at that!).</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>Tip #3:</em></strong> <em>Check the location/elevation of your accommodation when booking it.

Even though this walking stage is <strong>much shorter</strong> than the <strong>previous one</strong>, I still found it challenging because it was hilly.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>Tip #4:</em></strong> <em>Take frequent breaks and stay hydrated - hiking on a hilly terrain can be exhausting, especially in the summer heat.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>When we arrived in Betanzos, we were delighted to find that they had assigned us a <strong><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/FPQmGRjToyYDPypF7" target="_blank">wonderful hotel</a></strong> managed by a <strong>master hotelier</strong>, who not only <strong>thoughtfully arranged</strong> to have our <strong>suitcases brought up to our room</strong> but also <strong>offered us ice-cold beverages</strong> upon arrival. After a quick shower and a short nap, my husband and I went to <strong><a href="https://www.gadis.es" target="_blank">Gadis</a></strong>, a Galician supermarket chain, to buy some snacks before going to Pilgrim’s Mass.</p> <p>During Mass, the <strong>spirited parish priest</strong> called the pilgrims up to the altar to receive a blessing. Afterwards, I was able to get the priest to bless an image of <strong><a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-san-pancracio.jpg" class="image-modal">San Pancracio</a></strong> (St. Pancras in English), that I carried with me during this Camino.</p> <h3 id="day-3-betanzos-to-bruma-249-km">Day 3: <a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day3-map.jpg" class="image-modal">Betanzos to Bruma (24.9 km)</a></h3> <p>We were able to head out early because the breakfast service at our hotel in Betanzos started at 7am, which meant that we could <strong>cover a lot of ground</strong> before the heat became too oppressive, as the forecast was <strong>clear skies</strong> for most of the day. This was not in our favor, as this walking stage (the second-longest one) was <strong>mostly uphill</strong>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>Tip #5:</em></strong> <em>Check the weather forecast each night in order to better plan for the next day of hiking.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Halfway through the uphill climb, we stopped at a fancy (yet affordable) <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/fpmQ7L8xhq7bAJh1A" target="_blank">restaurant</a> that was like <strong><a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-brasa-de-beche.jpg" class="image-modal">paradise</a></strong> in the middle of (what felt like) nowhere - it had <strong>great food</strong>, very <strong>friendly staff</strong>, a <strong>nice ambiance</strong>, and even a <strong>live performance</strong> by a talented singer!</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>Tip #6:</em></strong> <em>There are hardly any bars or eateries along this walking stage, so you should make full use of any that you come across.</em></p> </blockquote> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-100 w-lg-75 mb-3 mx-auto d-block"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-day03.jpg" alt="Camino de Santiago 2023 Abegondo path with no cover from the sun"/> <span class="attribution">Melquiades Aseron III</span> </div> <p>Energized after a leisurely lunch, we continued our journey - with the <strong>afternoon sun</strong> blazing directly overhead. There were <strong>hardly any trees</strong> along the path to top of the hill, which meant there was <strong>little cover from the sun</strong>, thus making the hike <strong>even more challenging</strong>. Upon reaching the highest point, we saw what we thought was a <strong><a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-abegondo-young-forest.jpg" class="image-modal">young eucalyptus forest</a></strong> (a tree that pilgrims will frequently see along the Camino) - we surmised that there must have been a forest fire a while back and that was what had made the area so bare.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>Tip #7:</em></strong> <em>When doing this stage, make sure to bring a hat of some kind and extra water to stay hydrated.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Reaching the summit meant that we were nearly at our destination, <strong>Bruma</strong>. As our assigned <strong><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/LVGv786GGE77n5qa6" target="_blank">hotel</a></strong> was about <strong>1.5km away</strong> from the Camino route, they had a <strong>pick-up service</strong> at a <strong><a href="https://www.caminoingles.gal/es/casa-avelina" target="_blank">bar</a></strong> that was well-known among pilgrims. However, we <strong>decided not</strong> to <strong>avail</strong> of the service as it just <strong>didn’t feel right</strong> getting on a van to skip a small part of the route - after all, the very <strong>essence of the Camino</strong> was to <strong>walk</strong> (i.e. <em>caminar</em> means to walk in Spanish).</p> <p>The <strong>hotel</strong> provided a hilarious experience. My husband was <strong>mildly horrified</strong> when we got there, as he suspected that it was more of a motel that catered to the post-party needs of a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/VzeUfm7H2bKTyi7v6" target="_blank">nearby nightclub’s</a> clientele. The <strong>funniest part</strong> was when we went down to have dinner and saw a <strong>smartly-dressed <a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-goat-head.jpg" class="image-modal">goat’s head</a></strong> mounted on the wall - I told him that it was hilarious to find such a <strong><a href="https://www.churchofsatan.com/history-sigil-of-baphomet/" target="_blank">symbol of Satan</a></strong> while we were doing the Camino.</p> <h3 id="day-4-bruma-to-sigüeiro-242-km">Day 4: <a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day4-map.jpg" class="image-modal">Bruma to Sigüeiro (24.2 km)</a></h3> <p>The <strong>breakfast</strong> at our hotel in <strong>Bruma</strong> was the saddest and most disappointing one, as it consisted merely of a <strong>hot drink</strong>, an <strong>orange juice</strong> (we each received a glass with a <strong>different shade of orange</strong>!), and a <strong>croissant</strong> that tasted like <strong>paper</strong>. On the <strong>bright side</strong>, their breakfast service started at <strong>7am</strong>, so we were able to head out early (my husband couldn’t get out of there fast enough!).</p> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-100 w-lg-50 ms-lg-3 mb-3 float-end"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-day04.jpg" alt="Camino de Santiago 2023 a very misty morning in Bruma"/> <span class="attribution">Melquiades Aseron III</span> </div> <p>It was very <strong>misty</strong> when we headed out, which made me think that Bruma somehow <strong>lives up to its name</strong> (bruma means sea mist in Spanish). It was a <strong>very pleasant</strong> and <strong>serene hike</strong> because it was <strong>nice and cool</strong> with virtually <strong>nobody around</strong> - not even passing vehicles. It was also a <strong>very easy hike</strong> because there were <strong>no more major uphill climbs</strong> for the <strong>rest of the way</strong> to Santiago de Compostela.</p> <p>Most of the hike was <strong>uneventful</strong>, and the only challenge we had was finding our accommodation in Sigüeiro because the route became <strong>more confusing</strong> as we got closer to the highway that goes to Santiago de Compostela, mostly due to the <strong>lack of the iconic mojones</strong> and <strong>painted yellow arrows</strong>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>Tip #8:</em></strong> <em>Pilgrims quickly develop an ability to spot mojones and yellow arrows, but will come across tricky ones which are hidden from view (such as those that <a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-mojon-facing-away.jpg" class="image-modal">aren’t directly facing you as you approach</a> or buried in dense overgrowth), or where the paint on a <a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-faded-yellow-arrow.jpg" class="image-modal">yellow arrow is so faded</a> that it’s hardly visible anymore.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>When we finally arrived at our <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/nGZgW8CSVm2KA1m56" target="_blank">accommodation</a> (a large house that was converted into a mini-resort), we were greeted by its <strong>very friendly manager</strong> who spoke <strong>Galician with a charming accent</strong>. As it was located a kilometer or so away from the route with no nearby stores or bars, we decided to <strong>order some snacks</strong> from our nice Galician hostess to <strong>enjoy on the porch</strong>.</p> <p>Dinner was another <strong>interesting experience</strong>, because what they had was refrigerated <strong>Hacendado</strong> meals from <strong><a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/cribeo/viral/20221111/8603584/estadounidense-flipando-mercadona-venden-carne-conejo-supermercado.html" target="_blank">Mercadona</a></strong>, including the ice cream we got for dessert. I personally found it <strong>quirky bordering on funny</strong> (but I can imagine how other pilgrims <strong>wouldn’t be impressed</strong> with the <strong>sad food options</strong> after a long day’s hike), and everything made sense when we overheard (who we thought was) one of the owners explaining to a disgruntled guest that they <strong>didn’t have a permit</strong> to cook and serve their own food.</p> <p>On the <strong>bright side</strong>, the property had a <strong>porch swing</strong> where my husband and I enjoyed our dessert before turning in for the night.</p> <h3 id="day-5-sigüeiro-to-santiago-de-compostela-174-km">Day 5: <a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day5-map.jpg" class="image-modal">Sigüeiro to Santiago de Compostela (17.4 km)</a></h3> <p>The final day of our Camino started with a simple Spanish breakfast - a hot drink, some orange juice, a toast served with grated tomato sprinkled with olive oil and salt, and a croissant.</p> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-100 w-lg-50 ms-lg-3 mb-3 float-end"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-the-journey-day05.jpg" alt="Camino de Santiago 2023 the majestic cathedral"/> <span class="attribution">Melquiades Aseron III</span> </div> <p>It was another <strong>misty morning</strong> when we headed out, and because it was a national holiday (the <strong>Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary</strong>), the final stretch of our journey to Santiago was <strong>quiet and uneventful</strong>. The landscape also steadily became <strong>more urban</strong> as we got closer to our final destination, and we came across more pilgrims - including a Californian couple who commented on the steeper climbs on the Camiño Inglés, in comparison to the Camiño Francés that they also did last year.</p> <p>As the remaining distance was <strong>relatively short</strong>, we <strong>didn’t stop</strong> anywhere for a drink, but that <strong>also meant</strong> that we <strong>couldn’t add stamps</strong> to our <strong><a href="/blog/2023/09/06/camino-de-santiago-2023/#credencial-de-peregrino">Credenciales</a></strong>. Through some divine intervention, however, we <strong>came across</strong> a stand on the side of the road that had a <strong>stamp for pilgrims</strong> to use - the <strong>Lord does provide</strong>, indeed! We then walked past a <strong>small church</strong> when we arrived in Santiago that gave us <strong>our final stamp</strong>.</p> <p>We <strong>struggled to find</strong> mojones and yellow arrows when we reached the city <strong>on the Camiño Inglés</strong> route, which made for a <strong>vastly different experience</strong> when we did the <strong>Camiño Francés</strong>. The Camiño Inglés route <strong>also didn’t pass through</strong> the <a href="https://compostelaverde.santiagodecompostela.gal/places/miradoiro-do-monte-do-gozo" target="_blank">Monte de Gozo</a>, an <strong>absolute must</strong> for <strong>first-time pilgrims</strong>; but it wasn’t that much an issue for us because we had already seen it before, and we were <strong>focused on arriving</strong> at the Cathedral in time for the <strong>Pilgrim’s Mass</strong>.</p> <p>While we arrived in time for the Pilgrim’s Mass, the Cathedral had <strong>already reached its maximum capacity</strong>, and so we decided to just check into our very nice <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/G8NLn4r57Gibz8YK7" target="_blank">hotel</a> and return for the next <strong>Mass at 7:30pm</strong>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong><em>Tip #9:</em></strong> <em>You may want to time your arrival in Santiago de Compostela on a day when the Botafumeiro is used, as listed on the <a href="https://oficinadelperegrino.com/en/ufaq/when-is-the-botafumeiro-used" target="_blank">Cathedral’s website</a>.
