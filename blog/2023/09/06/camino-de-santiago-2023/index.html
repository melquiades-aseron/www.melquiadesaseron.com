We decided to do the Camino Inglés (the English Route), as we had already done the Camino Francés (the French Route) from Sarria last summer. This is the first in a series of posts that I will publishing about the 110km hike through the beautiful Galician countryside - a great adventure that is worth going on at least once in your life.</p> <h3 id="a-thousand-year-old-pilgrimage">A Thousand-Year-Old Pilgrimage</h3> <p><strong>O Camiño de Santiago</strong> (as the <strong>Way of St. James</strong> is called in Galician) is a <strong>pilgrimage</strong> to the city of <strong>Santiago de Compostela</strong> from different starting points. I will be using <strong>Camiño</strong> and <strong>Camino</strong> interchangeably in this post as pilgrims would <strong>encounter both terms</strong> along the way, and also because I like using Galician terms as a homage to my husband’s heritage and homeland.</p> <p>The pilgrimage traces its <strong>beginnings</strong> to the <strong>discovery</strong> of <strong>relics</strong> attributed to <strong>St. James the Great</strong> (Santiago el Mayor), the <strong>patron saint of Spain</strong>, in the <strong>9th century</strong>. <a href="https://www.elcaminoconcorreos.com/es/blog/historia-del-camino-de-santiago" target="_blank">One traditional account</a> tells the story of how <strong>St. James’ remains</strong> were brought to the <strong>Iberian peninsula</strong> by two of his disciples, buried, and eventually lost to time, until the <strong>tomb was rediscovered</strong> in the 9th century by a hermit called <strong>Pelayo</strong> (not to be confused with Don Pelayo, the first King of Asturias). A local bishop declared the remains as belonging to St. James, and reported it to the Asturian monarch, <strong>Alfonso II</strong>, who became the <strong>first pilgrim</strong> by venturing to the site using a route now known as “<strong>Camino Primitivo</strong>”.</p> <p>The site is now known as Santiago de Compostela, combining the Spanish name of St. James and the Latin term “<strong>composita tella</strong>”, <a href="https://www.elespanol.com/quincemil/articulos/actualidad/de-donde-viene-el-nombre-de-santiago-de-compostela-el-origen-del-toponimo" target="_blank">a eufemism for cemetery</a>.</p> <h3 id="the-english-way">The English Way</h3> <p>While there are <strong>a number of pilgrimage</strong> routes to Santiago de Compostela across Spain, the <strong>most traversed</strong> Caminos are the <em>Francés</em>, <em>Inglés</em>, <em>Portugués</em> and <em>Primitivo</em>. There’s also a hiking route that starts from Santiago de Compostela that <strong>ends in Fisterra</strong> (from the Latin “finis terrae”, literally the “end of the earth”).</p> <p>The <strong>English Way</strong> was the route that pilgrims from the <strong>British Isles</strong> and <strong>Scandinavia</strong> took to Santiago de Compostela, until it <strong><a href="https://www.caminodesantiago.gal/es/planifica/las-rutas/camino-ingles" target="_blank">fell into disuse</a></strong> after <strong>Henry VIII</strong> of England broke ties with the pope and <strong>established the Anglican Church</strong>, one of the most important events during the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/religion/reformation" target="_blank">Protestant Reformation</a> which swept through Northern and Central Europe.</p> <p>We have only done <strong>Camiños Francés</strong> and <strong>Inglés</strong> so far, but there is a such a <strong>big difference</strong> in terms of the experience we got from each one that it’s worth listing some of the points of comparison here.</p> <h4 id="camiño-inglés-vs-camiño-francés">Camiño Inglés vs. Camiño Francés</h4> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Popularity</strong> - Based on our experience, the <strong>Camiño Francés</strong> is by far the <strong>more popular route</strong>, because when we did it last year, the continuous stream of pilgrims wishing you “<strong>¡Buen camino!</strong>” meant that my husband and I rarely found ourselves alone (which also made it difficult to answer an urgent call of nature). <strong>In contrast</strong>, my husband and I had the route to ourselves most of the time in the open country when we did the <strong>Camiño Inglés</strong> - despite the fact that we did both at almost the exact time of the year.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Terrain</strong> - The <strong>Camiño Inglés</strong> goes through a steep, hilly landscape that makes it <strong>the more difficult route</strong> in terms of terrain. It also goes through more highways (i.e. a harsh urban landscape) and more open fields (i.e. less cover from the sun). On the other hand, the <strong>Camiño Francés</strong> has a <strong>more pleasant terrain</strong>, with idyllic landscapes filled with pastures, gently sloping hills, and forested areas that I called “enchanted forests” because they reminded me of scenes from Sleeping Beauty (1959).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Available Services</strong> - In addition to being less traversed, the lands along the <strong>Camiño Inglés</strong> were also <strong>sparsely populated</strong> in comparison to those in the Camiño Francés. As someone who loves trinkets for souvenirs, I can recall only a handful of souvenir-refreshment stands along the Camiño Inglés (excluding those in towns), and two of them were unmanned! This is <strong>in stark contrast</strong> to the numerous shops that we encountered along the <strong>Camiño Francés</strong>, where pilgrims had the luxury of not having to pack a bottle of water because the next refreshment stand was always just up ahead.</p> </li> </ol> <p>For <strong>first-timers</strong>, I would <strong>recommend</strong> doing the <strong>Camiño Francés</strong> because it provides a <strong>fuller and more exciting</strong> Camino experience that whets one’s appetite for more. On the other hand, the <strong>more quiet Camiño Inglés</strong> allows more time for <strong>thoughtful contemplation</strong>, encouraging one to reconnect with themself (and their partner) while marveling at the beauty that life can offer.</p> <h4 id="a-five-day-journey">A Five-Day Journey</h4> <p>We followed a five-day route that started from the city of <strong>Ferrol</strong> (the birthplace of the Spanish Dictator, General Franco). The <strong>other option</strong> was to start from the charming city of <strong>A Coruña</strong>, but this was <strong>not an option for us</strong> because we already live in that city and also because the route is <strong>shorter</strong>, which meant we would have been <strong>disqualified</strong> from receiving the <strong><a href="#la-compostela">Compostela</a></strong> (in this context, the word refers to the document issued by the Cathedral’s Pilgrim Office).</p> <p>While a pilgrim is free to organize their route by dividing it into as many stages as they please, we followed the <strong>route organized by <a href="#using-a-professional-service">Tu Buen Camino</a></strong>, a company that specifically caters to Camino pilgrims. I came to appreciate the route set by Tu Buen Camino because it seemed to have been carefully planned by <strong>evenly spreading</strong> the <strong>difficult parts</strong> across the entire route, as opposed to going about it on our own - we heard stories of people not being able to complete the Camiño Inglés because they made the <strong>mistake</strong> of trying to <strong>cover too much ground</strong> in a single walking stage.</p> <p>Here’s a <strong>brief summary</strong> of our Camiño Inglés itinerary, where I’ve included screenshots of the data logged on the <strong>Apple Fitness app</strong> to show the <strong>distance</strong>, the <strong>elevation</strong>, and the <strong>time</strong> we took to complete each stage. I will be covering this in more detail in a future post.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Day 0: Arrival in Ferrol</p> </li> <li> <p>Day 1: <a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day1-map.jpg" class="image-modal">Ferrol to Pontedeume (28.1 km)</a></p> </li> </ul> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-50 w-lg-25 mb-3 mx-auto d-block d-lg-none"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day1-map.jpg" alt="Apple Fitness log showing Camino Inglés route from Ferrol to Pontedeume"/> <span class="attribution"></span> </div> <ul> <li>Day 2: <a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day2-map.jpg" class="image-modal">Pontedeume to Betanzos (19.7 km)</a></li> </ul> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-50 w-lg-25 mb-3 mx-auto d-block d-lg-none"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day2-map.jpg" alt="Apple Fitness log showing Camino Inglés route from Pontedeume to Betanzos"/> <span class="attribution"></span> </div> <ul> <li>Day 3: <a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day3-map.jpg" class="image-modal">Betanzos to Bruma (24.9 km)</a></li> </ul> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-50 w-lg-25 mb-3 mx-auto d-block d-lg-none"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day3-map.jpg" alt="Apple Fitness log showing Camino Inglés route from Betanzos to Bruma"/> <span class="attribution"></span> </div> <ul> <li>Day 4: <a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day4-map.jpg" class="image-modal">Bruma to Sigüeiro (24.2 km)</a></li> </ul> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-50 w-lg-25 mb-3 mx-auto d-block d-lg-none"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day4-map.jpg" alt="Apple Fitness log showing Camino Inglés route from Betanzos to Sigüiero"/> <span class="attribution"></span> </div> <ul> <li>Day 5: <a href="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day5-map.jpg" class="image-modal">Sigüeiro to Santiago de Compostela (17.4 km)</a></li> </ul> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-50 w-lg-25 mb-3 mx-auto d-block d-lg-none"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/camino-de-santiago-2023-day5-map.jpg" alt="Apple Fitness log showing Camino Inglés route from Sigüiero to Santiago"/> <span class="attribution"></span> </div> <h3 id="organizing-the-pilgrimage">Organizing the Pilgrimage</h3> <p>Just as a pilgrim has the <strong>freedom</strong> to split their chosen path into walking stages that best suits their needs, they can also <strong>organize</strong> the journey <strong>as they see fit</strong>, which can be divided into two main categories.</p> <h4 id="diy-pilgrimage">DIY Pilgrimage</h4> <p>While my husband and I have <strong>never done a DIY Camino</strong>, we know that organizing one’s Camino de Santiago journey on one’s own <strong>requires thorough research</strong> and, to be honest, <strong>prayer</strong> (or for non-religious folks, <strong>luck</strong>) - because a lot of <strong>things can go wrong</strong> during the Camino.</p> <p>To aid one’s research, the <strong>Xunta de Galicia</strong> has a <a href="https://www.caminodesantiago.gal/es/inicio" target="_blank">website</a> dedicated to providing interested pilgrims with as much information as they need to prepare for their journey, including the most important - accommodation.</p> <h5 id="diy-accommodation">DIY Accommodation</h5> <p>There are three types of lodging that a pilgrim can use throughout their journey:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Public albergues</strong> (pilgrim hostels run by the Xunta de Galicia)</li> <li><strong>Privately-owned albergues</strong></li> <li><strong>Hotels or bed &amp; breakfasts</strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>Albergues</strong> are, of course, the <strong>cheaper option</strong> but also have the same <strong>disadvantages</strong> as those found when staying in a <strong>hostel</strong> (e.g. shared sleeping quarters and bathrooms, risk of personal belongings being stolen, etc.).</p> <p>In addition, albergues run by the Xunta de Galicia <strong>impose certain <a href="https://www.caminodesantiago.gal/es/descubre/el-camino-en-la-actualidad/la-red-de-albergues-publicos" target="_blank">rules</a></strong>, such as a <strong>one-night limit on stays</strong>, <strong>lights out at 10:30pm</strong>, and an early <strong>check-out at 8am</strong>.</p> <p>Another <strong>thing to be aware of</strong> when it comes to <strong>public albergues</strong> (as opposed to booking a hotel room in advance) is that they are accessed on a <strong>first come, first served basis</strong>. This was explained to me by my husband on my first Camino last year (Camiño Francés), after I commented on how pilgrims always seemed to be in a hurry to get to the next stop.</p> <h5 id="backpacks--luggage">Backpacks &amp; Luggage</h5> <p>Many pilgrims (if not the majority of them) make the pilgrimage as <strong>backpackers</strong>, carrying all of their belongings with them across the entire route. While this is the kind of pilgrim that many people would regard as the “<strong>traditional</strong>” type, <strong>times have changed</strong> to accommodate a <strong>new kind of pilgrim</strong> - the one who needs a luggage but can’t carry it with them throughout the entire journey.</p> <p>This is why <strong>Correos</strong>, the Spanish national postal service, has come to offer <strong><a href="#luggage-transportation">luggage transportation</a></strong> from one walking stage to another. This is especially useful for pilgrims from overseas who need a luggage for travel.</p> <p>Nonetheless, it must be noted that <strong>not all albergues</strong> accept luggage delivery from Correos, so this must be considered when planning one’s journey.</p> <h4 id="using-a-professional-service">Using a Professional Service</h4> <p>As I mentioned above, we used <a href="https://tubuencamino.com" target="_blank">Tu Buen Camino</a>’s services in order to be able to better <strong>focus on maximizing our enjoyment of the experience</strong> and to <strong>minimize the stress</strong> that comes with organizing an almost week-long journey.</p> <p>Just to set things straight, this is <strong>not</strong> a sponsored post. Having said that, my husband and I are <strong>pleased with Tu Buen Camino’s services</strong>, ever since he used them on his first Camino in 2021. This is because Tu Buen Camino <strong>organizes your Camino itinerary</strong> for you.</p> <p>The service offers Premium and Adventure options, the main distinction being the type of accommodation you will be given throughout your journey.</p> <h5 id="accommodation">Accommodation</h5> <p>We <strong>didn’t have to worry</strong> about <strong>finding a place to stay</strong> during the pilgrimage, which - let’s face it - is <strong>a stressful and time-consuming part</strong> of any travel because of factors such as budget constraints, location, decision paralysis, and, in our case, going through numerous online reviews.</p> <p>On the other hand, it is <strong>important to note</strong> that since Tu Buen Camino chooses the accommodation for you, you have <strong>no choice but to go with what they assign</strong> - this can mean being assigned a B&amp;B near the top of a steep hill in Pontedeume after a 28-km hike, but it can also mean being assigned a beautiful hotel room in Betanzos with a wonderful lady as the concierge. It’s <strong>like opening</strong> a <strong>surprise box of chocolates</strong>.</p> <p>It is worth noting that we used the Premium service, which gave us a private room at each lodging. Tu Buen Camino’s Adventure option gives their clients a bed at private albergues.</p> <h5 id="meals">Meals</h5> <p>We decided to <strong>include meals in our package</strong>, which meant that the accommodation at each stop needed to provide us with a dinner and a breakfast.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Dinner</strong>: Many of the lodgings on this Camino did not have an in-house dinner service, which meant that they had a <strong>partner restaurant</strong> where we went to have dinner as part of the package.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Breakfast</strong>: On this Camino, every accommodation provided breakfast service (as opposed to last year’s Camiño Francés where several of the accommodations had a partner eatery for breakfast). The main <strong>disadvantage</strong> of this arrangement is that the start of breakfast service will <strong>determine how early you can start</strong> the day’s journey. You can always skip breakfast and just stop somewhere along the way, but who likes skipping a meal they’ve already paid for.</p> </li> </ul> <h5 id="luggage-transportation">Luggage Transportation</h5> <p>Tu Buen Camino <strong>partners with Correos</strong> to arrange <a href="https://www.elcaminoconcorreos.com/es/envio-maletas" target="_blank">luggage transportation</a> from one walking stage to the next.
