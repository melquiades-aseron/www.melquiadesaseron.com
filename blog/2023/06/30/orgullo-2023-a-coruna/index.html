Just like in many cities across the world, the <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/glossary-of-terms" target="_blank">LGBTQ+</a> community in A Coruña held a <strong>Pride March</strong> (<em>Marcha de Orgullo Gay</em> in Spanish) filled with <strong>rainbows</strong> that symbolize the <strong>diversity</strong> of the community and the <strong>colorful contributions</strong> they make to humanity.</p> <h3 id="lgbtq-community--allies-proudly-march-in-a-coruña">LGBTQ+ Community &amp; Allies Proudly March in A Coruña</h3> <p>A <strong>sea of color</strong> washed over the coastal city of A Coruña as its LGBTQ+ Community flooded its streets with the <strong>gay colors</strong> of the Rainbow Flag, which flowed smoothly from Plaza de Ourense to Plaza de María Pita.</p> <p>Despite the <strong>lack of official support</strong> from the city government, made evident by the fact that the Rainbow Flag has <strong>not been flown</strong> at the Municipal Palace for the <strong>past four years</strong> (and counting), other government agencies, such as the Port Authority, showed their solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community by doing so.</p> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-100 w-lg-50 ms-lg-3 mb-3 float-end"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/orgullo-2023-a-coruna-autoridad-portuaria.jpg" alt="The Port Authority of A Coruña flies the Rainbow Flag"/> <span class="attribution"></span> </div> <p>Used to defying the odds stacked against it, the LGBTQ+ Community went on with the annual parade, giving all of its members <strong>hope</strong> by showing that they are <strong>not alone</strong> and by exhorting them to <strong>resist a wave of ultra-right politics</strong> that <strong>dehumanize LGBTQ+</strong> folk by calling them <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.es/politica/gordillo-vox-pide-comprension-concejal-comparo-bandera-lgtbi-pedofilia.html" target="_blank">pedophiles</a>.</p> <div class="clearfix"></div> <h3 id="rainbows--smiles">Rainbows &amp; Smiles</h3> <p>The <strong>Rainbow Flag</strong> has a lot of meaning behind it, whether historical or personal. <a href="https://www.history.com/news/how-did-the-rainbow-flag-become-an-lgbt-symbol" target="_blank">Historically</a>, it was designed by <a href="https://gilbertbaker.com/biography/" target="_blank">Gilbert Baker</a> after having been commissioned by <a href="https://milkfoundation.org/about/harvey-milk-biography" target="_blank">Harvey Milk</a>, and its colors were intended to <em>“represent togetherness, since LGBT people come in all races, ages and genders, and rainbows are both natural and beautiful”.</em></p> <p>From a <strong>personal standpoint</strong>, the Rainbow Flag carries as many meanings as there are members of the LGBTQ+ community, and I like to think most, if not all, of them has <strong>hope at its center</strong> - as its <strong>vibrant colors</strong> serve as a <strong>beacon</strong> to guide those <strong>lost in the darkness</strong> of the closets they have been <strong>pushed into</strong> by society. Here are a couple of examples from me:</p> <h5 id="the-prism">The Prism</h5> <p>As children, we learned that <strong>boring visible light</strong>, when passed through a <strong>prism</strong>, is refracted to <strong>reveal multiple colors</strong>. The prism <strong>slows down</strong> the <strong>light waves</strong> and, since the different light colors that make up white light don’t all travel at the same speed, they can be <strong>seen individually</strong> in the order in which they are slowed down (for example, red light is slowed down the least and so it appears at the top, and violet light is slowed down the most so it appears at the bottom).</p> <p>The Rainbow Flag can be likened to a prism, encouraging us to <strong>take a moment and slow down</strong> the <a href="https://time.com/3083667/brain-trustworthiness" target="_blank">judgments that our brains make</a> about other people and maybe, just maybe, we can <strong>see the beauty</strong> they can bring to the world.</p> <h5 id="the-great-flood">The Great Flood</h5> <p>The very <strong>book</strong> that homophobes use to <strong>justify their violence</strong> against the LGBTQ+ folk contains symbolism that can bring hope even to such victims.</p> <blockquote> <p>I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.</p> <div style="text-align: right">Genesis 9:13-16</div> </blockquote> <p>It’s amusing to think that the <strong>playful and cheeky LGBTQ+ community</strong> can use this passage from the Bible to <strong>rub the Rainbow Flag in the noses</strong> of (mostly religious) homophobes, and at the same time <strong>remind ourselves</strong> that the <strong>Great Flood of Tears</strong> - whether shed or unshed - that comes at least once in the life of every LGBTQ+ member is due to the continual <strong>Storm of Insults and Violence</strong> inspired by the same book.</p> <h3 id="hard-earned-pride-after-a-life-of-shame">Hard-Earned Pride After a Life of Shame</h3> <p>The word “<strong>Pride</strong>” features prominently in LGBTQ+ activism, and when I first encountered terms containing the word, I found its usage strange, as I <strong>never really thought</strong> sexual orientation was <strong>something to be proud of</strong> because it’s just something <strong>that’s a part of us</strong> - it even alarmed me a bit to think that it may give straight people some justification to be proud of their own sexuality.</p> <p>Upon reflection, however, I found that the use of “Pride” in the LGBTQ+ movement is <strong>not rooted in arrogance</strong>, but is actually <strong>intended</strong> to help members of the community to <strong>break free of the shame</strong> that, one way or another, became part of their lives.</p> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-100 w-lg-50 ms-lg-3 mb-3 float-end"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/orgullo-2023-a-coruna-parade.jpg" alt="A scene from the 2023 Pride March in A Coruña"/> <span class="attribution"></span> </div> <h5 id="subconsciously-ashamed">Subconsciously Ashamed</h5> <p>I consider myself privileged not to have been left deeply traumatized by events related to my sexual orientation, as I realized at an early age of four/five that I was <strong>gay</strong> and I very quickly learned from the behavior of adults around me that <strong>being so was something that had to be concealed</strong> because it was <strong>highly undesirable</strong> and would <strong>cause great suffering</strong> on my end if I were to reveal it.</p> <p>While being secure in my identity allowed me to have a relatively carefree childhood filled with books, TV, and computer games, it also gave me a <strong>compulsion to overachieve</strong> in order to <strong>preemptively compensate</strong> for any <strong>shame</strong> that would instantly arise on the part of my <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/family/defining-your-family-of-origin-how-it-impacts-you/" target="_blank">family of origin</a> when I do <strong>dare to come out</strong> of my relatively cozy but nonetheless dark proverbial closet. It also <strong>did not shield me from pain</strong> whenever I was called nasty homophobic slurs (“<a href="https://www.wordsense.eu/pondan/" target="_blank">pondan</a>”) that made me <strong>quickly modify</strong> my mannerisms and behavior to protect myself from future verbal abuse.</p> <p>The privilege of growing up with little (if any) gender-related PTSD - thanks to <strong>an acute ability to adapt</strong> - did not leave me unscathed, though, especially when my sexual orientation <strong>came into conflict with other parts of my identity</strong>. Being raised to worship a God that was the source of all that is good while at the same time learning that the same God would <strong>condemn gay people</strong> to an eternity of fiery torment for <strong>“behavior against the laws of nature and God”</strong> is difficult for any child to take in. I was left <strong>grasping at straws</strong> to <strong>reconcile two very contrasting parts</strong> of my identity - both of which <strong>I did not choose</strong> to begin with - until I was able to come up with a <strong>personal compromise</strong> (hint: I effectively founded a gay-friendly branch of Catholicism in my mind).</p> <p>These only form part of a set of life experiences that ultimately produced an adult who very slightly <strong>panics</strong> when <strong>seen picking out a Pride shirt</strong> or <strong>thinks twice</strong> when <strong>kissing</strong> his husband in <strong>public</strong>. Someone with <strong>internalized shame</strong> buried deep within his subconscious, that he hardly thinks of it as shame, just a way of living.</p> <h5 id="lgbtq-children---casualties-in-a-world-where-homophobes-draw-blood-and-spit-poison">LGBTQ+ Children - Casualties in a World where Homophobes Draw Blood and Spit Poison</h5> <p>I was pleasantly surprised to see a large number of <strong>youths</strong> join the Pride March in A Coruña, and it was <strong>comforting to see</strong> that LGBTQ+ children these days have <strong>a strong support system</strong> waiting for them - if they are able to seek help in the first place.</p> <p>Nonetheless, International Pride Day is just one day in a year. For most of the year, LGBTQ+ children across the <a href="https://www.unicef.org/media/91126/file" target="_blank">world</a> <strong>generally suffer</strong> just for <strong>being different</strong>, facing <strong>discrimination</strong>, <strong>intimidation</strong>, <strong>harassment</strong> and <strong>violence</strong> on a regular basis. This applies to children both in <strong>developed countries</strong> such as <a href="https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20151230/mas-mitad-jovenes-homosexuales-sufrido-acoso-escolar-porcentaje-sube-transexuales/1279411.shtml" target="_blank">Spain</a> and the <a href="https://news.vumc.org/2022/02/24/study-finds-lgbq-people-report-higher-rates-of-adverse-childhood-experiences-than-straight-people-worse-mental-health-as-adults" target="_blank">United States</a>, and in <strong>developing countries</strong> such as <a href="https://chr.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2019.-THE-SITUATION-OF-LGBTQ-CHILDREN-IN-THE-PHILIPPINES-A-Report-by-the-Commission-on-Human-Rights-December-2019.pdf" target="_blank">the Philippines</a>.</p> <p>In some countries, things are taken to the <strong>extreme</strong> as the full might of state power is used to <strong>punish</strong> LGBTQ+ people <strong>just for being born the way they are</strong>, such as in <a href="https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2020/04/24/bruneis-stoning-for-gay-sex-law-flies-under-the-radar" target="_blank">Brunei</a>, where I grew up.</p> <p>The <strong>visibility</strong> of the LGBTQ+ Community and the <strong>support</strong> of its Allies is of <strong>tremendous help</strong> to children, by assuring them that <strong>they are not alone</strong> in this world and by showing them that there is a <strong>refuge</strong> where they <strong>are loved just the way they are</strong>.</p> <div class="image-with-attribution-container w-100 w-lg-50 ms-lg-3 mb-3 float-end"> <img class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/orgullo-2023-a-coruna-better-together.jpg" alt="An LGBTQ couple proudly showing their Rainbow Bracelet"/> <span class="attribution"></span> </div> <h5 id="coping-with-shame">Coping with Shame</h5> <p>The usual advice when it comes to <strong>dealing with psychological issues</strong> such as trauma is to <strong>seek the professional help</strong> of a <strong>therapist</strong> because it is the <strong>best piece of advice</strong>. Nonetheless, the ideal does not always coincide with reality and sometimes we need to make the most of what we have - ourselves.</p> <p>I personally found that <strong>self-awareness</strong> is a <strong>great starting point</strong> to <strong>healing</strong>, and it is achieved by <strong>asking oneself</strong> some difficult questions and trying to <strong>answer them honestly</strong> in a <strong>safe environment</strong>. Reputable websites such as the <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/how-to-deal-with-shame" target="_blank">Gottman Institute</a> and <a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/lgbt-suicide-and-the-trauma-of-growing-up-gay#mental-health" target="_blank">Psych Central</a> provide information that can help one prepare for a much-needed <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com" target="_blank">therapy session</a>.</p> <div class="clearfix"></div> <h3 id="lgbtq-rights-are-human-rights">LGBTQ+ Rights are Human Rights</h3> <p>Throughout history, LGBTQ+ folk have been targeted and <strong>treated abysmally</strong> on mostly <strong>religious grounds</strong> and such treatment was <strong>often enshrined in <a href="https://www.humandignitytrust.org/lgbt-the-law/a-history-of-criminalisation" target="_blank">law</a></strong>.</p> <p>Then the horrifying events of <strong>World War II</strong> saw the <strong>large-scale slaughter</strong> of <strong>vulnerable groups</strong> of people, <a href="https://time.com/5953047/lgbtq-holocaust-stories/" target="_blank">including LGBTQ+ folk</a>, which led to the adoption of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights" target="_blank">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> by the United Nation General Assembly in 1948. However, as with other international accords, the <strong>enforcement</strong> of such human rights are essentially done on a <strong>trust basis</strong> because it is left to <strong>member states</strong>, the <strong>usual perpetrators</strong> of human rights abuses which also happen to have <strong>a tendency to pick on</strong> people deemed immoral to instill fear in the population.</p> <p>The rise of LGBTQ+ movement <strong>united the voice</strong> of the community, which started <strong>demanding for recognition</strong> of the unique status of its members as <strong>being especially vulnerable</strong> to human rights abuses and for <strong>equal access to rights</strong> hitherto enjoyed only by heterosexual couples - something that has now become so <strong>politically charged</strong> that it makes one <strong>wonder why</strong> the <strong>clamor of a minority</strong> for equal rights <strong>seems like</strong> it <strong>diminishes</strong> or even takes away the rights of those in the <strong>majority</strong>.</p> <p>It needs to be <strong>spelled out</strong> that <strong>LGBTQ+ rights are human rights</strong> - when this finally sinks in, we <strong>stop the dehumanization</strong> of the LGBTQ+ community.</p> <h3 id="somewhere-over-the-rainbow">Somewhere Over The Rainbow</h3> <p>Most members of the LGBTQ+ Community, myself included, <strong>grew up wishing for a world</strong> that would <strong>accept and protect</strong> us. With the Rainbow Flag, we are starting to <strong>build that world</strong>.</p> <div class="img-thumbnail shadow-sm mb-3"> <div class="ratio ratio-16x9 plyr-video-embed"> <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSZxmZmBfnU" allowfullscreen="" allowtransparency="" allow="autoplay"></iframe> </div> </div> <div class="clearfix"></div> </div> <p> <small> <span class="post-date"> <i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days"></i> <time class="post-date" datetime="2023-06-30">30 Jun 2023</time> </span> </small> </p> <div> <ul class="tags"> <li> <a href="/blog/tag/history/">#history</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/tag/law/">#law</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/tag/lgbt/">#lgbt</a> </li> <li> <a href="/blog/tag/psychology/">#psychology</a> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="row d-flex justify-content-between font-weight-bold"> <span class="d-block col-md-6 lh-lg"> <a href="/blog/2023/06/29/noite-de-san-xoan/"> &laquo; Noite de San Xoán</a> </span> <span class="d-block col-md-6 lh-lg text-end"> <a href="/blog/2023/07/06/timesheets/">Timesheets &raquo;</a> </span> <div class="clearfix"></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="footer mt-auto"> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 text-center text-lg-start"> &copy; Melquiades Aseron III · <span class="text-nowrap"> <span class="fa-stack fa-2xs"> <i class="fa-solid fa-robot fa-stack-1x"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-ban fa-stack-2x" style="color: red; opacity: 0.5;"></i> </span> 100% AI-Free Content </span> </div> <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 text-center text-lg-end"> <span class="font-monospace">64e487e</span> · <span class="d-none d-lg-inline-block"> Powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> & <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages <i class="fab fa-github"></i></a> · </span> <a href="javascript:void(0);" aria-label="View cookie settings" data-cc="c-settings">Cookie Settings</a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="/assets/third-party/jquery-3.6.4/jquery-3.6.4.slim.min.js?v=64e487e"></script> <script src="/assets/third-party/bootstrap-5.2.3/bootstrap.bundle.min.js?v=64e487e"></script> <script src="/assets/third-party/cookieconsent-2.9.0/cookieconsent.js?v=64e487e"></script> <script src="/assets/third-party/plyr-3.7.8/plyr.polyfilled.js?v=64e487e"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js?v=64e487e"></script> </body> </html>
